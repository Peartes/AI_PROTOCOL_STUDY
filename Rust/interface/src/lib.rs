    /*
        FLEXIBLE INTERFACES

        - Avoid restricting callers more than you must
        - Accept generic arguments whenever reasonable
          * This lets the caller give you the cheapest, simplest type they have
          * Example: impl AsRef<str> instead of &str or String

        - Return types can also be flexible
          * Cow<'_, str> is a great way to let the implementation decide
            if a value is borrowed or owned

        - In function signatures:
            fn do_stuff(s: String) -> String
                - expects caller to allocate and you to allocate
                - hard to evolve without breaking

            fn do_stuff(s: &str) -> Cow<'_, str>
                - caller can pass by ref
                - you can return borrowed or owned
                - easier to change later

            fn do_stuff<T: AsRef<str>>(s: T) -> impl AsRef<str>
                - even more flexible
                - maximizes what can be passed and what can be returned

        - This is critical because relaxing restrictions is backwards compatible,
          but tightening them is a breaking change.

        - Rust empowers you to design this kind of flexibility
          through generics, trait bounds, lifetimes, and ownership choices.

        ðŸ’¡ Takeaway: be minimal in restrictions, maximal in promises.

    /*
        GENERIC ARGUMENTS

        - Generics let you write one piece of code that works for many concrete types
        - They increase flexibility *and* safety:
            * The compiler will verify that only compatible types can be used
            * You don't have to write code for each type manually

        - Use trait bounds to express what your generic types are capable of
            Example:
                fn compare<T: PartialOrd>(a: T, b: T) -> Ordering

        - Generics can apply to:
            * Types (structs, enums, etc.)
            * Functions
            * Traits

        - You can even make trait bounds generic themselves, via higher-ranked trait bounds.

        - Generics also work with lifetimes and const generics in modern Rust:
            * lifetimes: tie reference lifetimes together
            * const generics: parameterize types over compile-time values (array sizes, etc)

        - ðŸ’¡ Takeaway: design with generics so your interfaces are future-proof,
          reusable, and composable, while still type-safe.
