## My Program

This is a compilation of all the programs I have written in Go from the book [Machine Learning In Go](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/machine-learning-go) by Daniel Whitenack. The programs are organized by chapter and are listed below.

Chapter 1: Gathering and Organizing Data, Reading and Writing Data from database

Here I pivoted and registered on Scrimba's AI Engineering career path. I think short term goal is AI engineer so I can start applying these models into blockchain and education and more long term goal is Machine Learning Engineer (maybe in 2-3 years).
