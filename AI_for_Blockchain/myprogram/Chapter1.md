## Chapter 1

This is the first chapter of the book.

We are talking about data collection and organization. Even though this seems a little unimportant as say modelling, it is an important part of the process. Applying machine learning to Blockchain would require proper data collection and organization. The blockchain is basically a database and the data in it is structured in a way that makes it easy to access and verify. This is why it is important to understand how data is collected and organized.

Best Practices for Data Collection and Organization:

- Check for and enforce expected types
- Standardize and simplify your data ingress/egress
- Version your data
